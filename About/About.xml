	<description>Inspired by HelpfulBot's Increased Forest Density. This mod makes certain biomes have a more dense flora. Biomes affected are Boreal Forest, Temperate Forest, and Tropical Jungle. 
	It also adds support for 3 Terra Core biomes; Mountain Spires, Savanna and Oasis. It also adds support to Vegetable Garden wild fruit trees and plants, meaning they also get a higher spawn chance.
	Make sure to load at the lowest possible position so it can overwrite the changes.
